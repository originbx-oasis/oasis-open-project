# Origin Blockchain Exchange (OriginBX) OASIS Open Project Charter

OriginBX is an [OASIS Open Project](https://oasis-open-projects.org/). The project is a neutral forum for diverse stakeholders to create high-quality interoperable specifications for determining, obtaining, and verifying digital global tax and trade attestations (“GTTAs”). Examples of GTTAs include:

- Certifications of origin for purposes of qualifying an imported good for preferential treatment under a free trade agreement;
- Compliance with a government’s procurement policies (e.g., US Buy America Act), or avoiding non-preferential origin retaliatory tariffs (e.g., Section 301 China Tariffs);
- Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) classifications;
- Export controls;
- Customs valuation;
- Numerous participating government agency admissibility certifications (e.g., declarations for goods made without Forced Labor);
- Intellectual property rights;
- Sustainability; and,
- Certifications of residency/tax residency certifications for global withholding tax compliance.

For more information on OriginBX, see the project's website at https://originbx-oasis.org and the project's [charter](CHARTER.md).
