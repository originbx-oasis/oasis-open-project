#Become an OriginBX Sponsor

Funding for OriginBX is provided by a core group of stakeholder organizations committed to ensuring the work stays on-track and receives the resources it needs to succeed. 

The main reason to sponsor OriginBX is to ensure this work gets done and that your organization is able to reap the benefits of more efficient, less costly, and faster tax and trade compliance transactions. [OriginBX Sponsors](https://github.com/originbx-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/SPONSORS.md) provide funding thatâ€™s necessary for trusted open source development--vendor-neutral technical administration, IP management, governance, collaboration tools, community support, outreach, event services, and incentives for technical contributions. 

Sponsors are recognized for their role as OriginBX leaders in several ways.  

## Governance benefits
Each Sponsor organization has the option to hold a seat on the [OriginBX Project Governing Board] (https://github.com/originbx-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/PROJECT-GOVERNING-BOARD.md) (one-org/one-vote), where they:
* Provide top-level guidance for the OriginBX community
* Influence the development of OriginBX standards, ensuring their organization's perspectives and use cases are represented
* Appoint members to the OriginBX Technical Steering Committee 
* Approve formation of and provide oversight for industry-specific Working Groups
* Liase with the OriginBX Advisory Council of international and national policy-setting bodies and customs agencies
* Approve all final specifications and other deliverables 
* Decide which specifications to advance through the OASIS Open standards process
* Determine if/when approved work should be submitted to de jure standards bodies, e.g., ISO, IEC, ITU, UN/CEFACT.

## Visibility benefits
OriginBX Sponsors receive extra visibility for their support of the work. They:
* Stand out on the [OriginBX website](http://originbx-oasis.org) and in social media
* Have their executive quotes and organization name featured in OriginBX press releases
* Provide testimonial quotes for the website
* Speak on behalf of OriginBX at conferences, workshops, and other events
* May participate in interoperability demos and plugfests
* May use the OriginBX logo to promote their sponsorship

## Sponsorship Levels
Each organization pays annual [OASIS Open Project Sponsorship dues](https://www.oasis-open.org/join/#membership-dues-op) based on its total employee headcount.

We encourage all organizations that benefit from OriginBX standards to sponsor this critical, nonprofit initiative. For information on becoming an OriginBX Sponsor, [contact OASIS](mailto:communications@oasis-open.org).
