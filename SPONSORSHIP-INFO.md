# Become an OriginBX Sponsor

OriginBX is supported by an international alliance of organizations committed to advancing interoperable data standards for cross border tax and trade attestations. New members are welcome.

The main reason to sponsor OriginBX is to ensure your organization--and the world--can reap the benefits of more efficient, less costly, and faster tax and trade compliance transactions. 

[OriginBX Sponsors](https://github.com/originbx-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/SPONSORS.md) are recognized for their leadership in several ways.  

## Governance benefits
Each Sponsor organization has the option to hold a seat on the [OriginBX Project Governing Board](https://github.com/originbx-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/PROJECT-GOVERNING-BOARD.md) where they:
* Provide top-level guidance for the OriginBX community
* Influence the development of OriginBX standards, ensuring their organization's perspectives and use cases are represented
* Approve all final specifications and other deliverables (one org/one vote)
* Decide which specifications to advance through the OASIS Open standards process
* Determine when approved work should be submitted to de jure standards bodies, e.g., ISO, IEC, ITU, UN/CEFACT
* Appoint members to the OriginBX Technical Steering Committee 
* Approve formation of and provide oversight for industry-specific Working Groups
* Liase with the OriginBX Advisory Council, a group representing international and national policy-setting bodies and customs agencies

## Visibility benefits
OriginBX Sponsors receive exclusive visibility for their support. They:
* Stand out on the [OriginBX website](http://originbx-oasis.org) and in social media
* Have their organizations named and their executive quotes featured in OriginBX press releases
* Provide testimonial quotes for the website
* Speak on behalf of OriginBX at conferences, workshops, and other events
* May participate in interoperability demos and plugfests
* May use the OriginBX logo to promote their sponsorship

## Sponsorship Levels
Each organization pays annual [OASIS Open Project Sponsorship dues](https://www.oasis-open.org/join/#membership-dues-op) based on its total employee headcount. Dues are used to provide core services including vendor-neutral governance, technical administration, IP management, collaboration tools, community support, and outreach. 

We encourage all organizations that benefit from OriginBX standards to sponsor this critical, nonprofit initiative. For information on becoming an OriginBX Sponsor, [contact OASIS](mailto:communications@oasis-open.org).
